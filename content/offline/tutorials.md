# Tutorials

The first part (lessons 1 to 3) covers essential functions of DFF. We focus on how to create or import molecular models, and how to use TEAMFF force fields.
The second part (lessons 4 to 6) is about parameterization. The topics are quantum mechanics data (QMD) generation, fit QMD to get charge and valence parameters, and fit liquid data to optimize LJ parameters.
The last part (lessons 7 and 8) shows how to use the database functionalities. To increase coverage of TEAMFF by adding new force fields, and to make specific force field from QMD directly.  

The tutorials illustrate how to use the software. More background information can be found in [Concepts, Methods and Algorithms](../topics/introduction.md). Commands are explained in [Reference of GUI Commands](../gui-commands/introduction.md) and [Reference of Executable Commands](../exe-commands/introduction.md).
