# Build a Force Field
A procedure of making a force field for a group of molecules.

If this lesson, we practice how to make a force field for simulation. We use a polymer as example, however, the methods used here apply to any molecules.

# Training set
From the molecule, make a collection of fragments

# QMD
Run Gaussian to get QMD data

# Fit
Fit all together, can be tricky.

# Validate
