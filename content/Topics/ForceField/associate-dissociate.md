# Associate and Dissociate Force Field

To associate one or more models with a force field will make links of the models to the force field, enabling simulations of the models with the associated force field. It will test if the force field has a full coverage of the models. The charge parameters will be assigned to the models.

To dissociate a force field just break the links, and set the atomic charges to zero.
