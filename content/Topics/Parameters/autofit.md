# Automated Fitting Procedures

- To fit QMD automatically is designed for developing force field parameters quickly and reliably.
- A method called `AutoFit QMD` is designed to fit QMD for valence and charge parameters. In this procedure, Default atom types are used, the force field types supported are TEAM and AMBER.
- The procedure adjust hyper parameters and parameters spaces, validate the fit, examine result parameters and seek the best over all results.
