# Model

A Model is a molecular system in DFF. It can be an single molecule, a set of molecules, or a macromolecule, in isolation or in a 3-D periodic condition. 

## Essential Data
The essential information of a model is its atomic coordinations in 3D space. In addition, connectivity of atoms, in terms of bond and bond orders, are required to completely define a model. The connectivity can be calculated if atomic coordinates are given reasonably correct.


## Derived Data
The following data may be computed for a model, which are used for various purposes:
- atomic partial charges 
- atom types
- group atoms
- substructure atoms
- formal charges

## MSD File
Models are saved as Molecular Structure Data (.msd) file. The format of MSD file is specified in the [appendix](../../Appendix/file-formats.md#1-molecular-structure-data-msd-file)
