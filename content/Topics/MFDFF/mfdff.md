# MFDFF Method

MFDFF stands for "Molecular Fragment Described Force Field". The key point is to construct force fields on-the-fly using QM data of molecular fragments. This method avoids the missing parameters problem associated with the transitional *centralized* approach in which developers make a general force field attempting to meet broad ranges of applications. Instead, MFDFF is a *distributed* approach, enable users to make customized force fields on-the-fly using database-stored or freshly computed QM data of molecular fragments.
