# Fit Molecular Dimer

DFF can determine nonbond parameters by fitting molecular dimers in which inter-molecular interactions are represented by VDW and electrostatic terms only. To fit VDW parameters, a number of configurations of the dimer should be generated and calculated with relatively high-level QM calculations (MP2 with sufficiently large basis set). DFF automatically freezes other parameters and fits potential energies of dimers in different configurations using the Levenberg-Marquardt method49.
It should be noted that this approach might not work well for predicting physical properties of molecules in condensed phases. Although in principle the VDW parameters can be derived by fitting to QM data calculated for molecular dimers, this approach has the following limitations. a) it is very difficult to accurately describe weak VDW interactions using QM method, high level of theory and an extensive basis set must be used. b) the dimer is too small to represent molecular interactions in condensed phases. The result energetic data only represents molecular interactions in gas phase, which in many cases can be significantly different from those found in the condensed phases.
