## Additional Mouse Operations

Click the selection (arrow) button in the command bar panel to activate the mouse selection function. Once it is activated, click on an atom will pick up the atom. You can also press the left button and drag the mouse to select multiple atoms. You can cut, copy, and paste the selected atoms, to the same model but different location (where the mouse point is) and to a different model.

The common short-cut keys are supported, the combination keys Ctrl + C, Ctrl +X and Ctrl + V are used for cutting, copy and paste respectively. In addition, Ctrl + V and Ctrl + Y are used for undo and redo, which are the same as the undo and redo buttons in the toolbar.
