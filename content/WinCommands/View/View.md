## View Menu

These commands are used to set manipulate view options. 

- **Measure** displays measured molecular properties of the selected molecule. The following properties can be measured:
    - Length 
    - Angle
    - Dihedral Angle
    - OOP Angle
    - Dipole Moment

    The Measurements are taken by using mouse clicks. With a measurement property selected, click on atoms to measure the values. The length is measured by using two atoms, angle is measured by using three consecutively selected atoms, dihedral angle is measured by four consecutively picked atoms. The OOP angle is measured between the bond of atoms 1 and 2 and plane of atoms 2, 3 and 4. Note that the atoms do not have to be bonded. 

- **Pack View** displays all atoms inside of a periodic box,  without change the coordinates.

- **Job Monitor** toggles a display of background DFF jobs.

- **IDE Options** changes the Look-and-Feel style on the Windows platform. 

- **Display Style** changes the molecular rendering style:
    - Line is the default style in which colored lines indicate atoms and bonds. Isolated atoms are displayed as a circle.
    - Stick is a style in which thick lines indicate for atoms and bonds.
    - Stick and Ball - a style in which thick lines indicate bonds and balls indicate atoms.
    - CPK is the space-filling Corey, Pauling, Koltun (CPK) model.
