## TEAMFF Check-in Dialog

- **Database** shows the database selected. 

- **Table** lists the force field table to be augmented. The force field can be selected using the pull-down menu. Note that system force fields cannot be changed, choose a customer force field.  

- **Type** is fixed since the database table has already been selected. 

- **Version** is automatically updated in minor revision increments. A major version increment can be manually set via the pull-down menu.

- **Force field** lists the force field to be checked in. It should be a ppf file.  

- **Description** will be saved in the log file.

The parameters in ppf will be compared with existing parameters, only new (different) parameters will be added with a higher version number.
